# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I'm ali abdalrhe!<br><br>🔧 I'm a Junior Developer passionate about cybersecurity, software development, and open-source contributions. My journey in tech began with a strong interest in understanding how systems work and how to protect them from threats.<br><br>💻 Currently, I'm working on my graduation project, which involves building an antivirus scanner using Java. This project not only challenges my coding skills but also deepens my understanding of malware detection and prevention techniques.<br><br>🎯 My long-term goal is to specialize in cybersecurity, particularly in threat analysis and defense strategies. I aspire to contribute to open-source projects that enhance internet security and protect users from emerging threats.<br><br>📚 In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, exploring new technologies, and delving deeper into Linux systems. I also spend time reading books to expand my knowledge. I've worked with various Linux distributions, including Kali Linux, Garuda Linux, and Fedora, and I  use Arch Linux By the way. Each of these distributions has provided me with unique insights into system security and performance optimization.<br><br>🌱 I'm always eager to learn and grow in the field, and I'm open to collaboration on interesting projects. Whether it's developing a new tool, solving a complex problem, or simply sharing knowledge, I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals.<br>
